        <h1>Project</h1>

        <p>For my project, I’ve decided to develop a mobile app that encourages people to take care and understand their
        mental health. It will do this by gamifying tasks that are beneficial to your mental health such as taking
        regular walks outside, encouraging meditation and limiting use of social media apps. The app will consist of a
        virtual cartoon version of yourself which you earn points by completing tasks. These points in turn could be
        used to decorate your character’s area and clothes. The app will be strictly no in app purchase, and focus
        instead on a monthly membership at a low cost.</p>

        <p>Mental health awareness has been increasing, however, a lot of people either don’t understand how to deal with
        it or struggle to keep up with it. My idea comes from a mixture of a few devices and games. Tamagotchi (a
        virtual pet in a pocket sized egg device), Pokemon GO!, Animal Crossing and Ring Fit. All four of these have had
        a very positive effect on mental health, physical health and have also been very successful. Everyone has a
        phone, so creating it as an app rather than a stand alone device will make it a lot more accessible for people.</p>

        <p>The app will be able for free on the Google Play and Apple app stores on smart devices. You will have a cartoon
        character, customisable by you when you start the app. The app will have control of the amount of time you can
        access social media apps like Twitter and Instagram, and have a scaled point reward system on how much time you
        use the app. Quitting straight away is hard, so one of the big features would be slowly limiting the time you
        have. For e.g. maybe you would start with one hour of time four days a week, and 30 minutes on the other three,
        Monday, Wednesday and Friday being the 30 minute days. It would also work similar to this with walking. The app
        would track your steps, and start by encouraging you to take three 25 minute walks in the beginning, then
        encouraging you to walk more then next week if you want to continue collecting a high amount of points. These
        points would be used to buy ingame clothing, furniture, cosmetics etc.
        The paid model of the app would give you access to a “courtyard” area where you can plant and water plants
        through meditation, an area to place furniture and a magical pet. Watering and caring for your plants through
        guided meditation will allow them to thrive and have a higher chance of blooming.
        The magical pet could be a cute little kitten, a flying dragon etc. that will have some “off” days like humans
        do, and will use these days to show the user little tips on how to take care of yourself in these situations.
        To keep users engaged, there will be monthly events and items. During certain seasons, for e.g. spring, you
        might be able to get rare flowers you otherwise can't obtain. Events would bring a social element to the game. A
        monthly flower show where users can visit each other’s “courtyard” and vote on who had the best design or the
        rarest flowers. These events would be a chance to obtain extremely rare items, meaning the only way you could
        get these is by constantly taking care of your mental health.</p>

        <p>The user interface will be one of the most important elements of the app. Often when I try these apps, if it is
        clunky, full of ads, unresponsive and confusing I delete it straight away. As the app will need to run on iOS
        and Android, steps will need to be taken so they both run identically on both OS. Unity will be used as the
        engine to create the app as the UI and graphics will need to be eye catching and engaging in order to keep the
        users attention to come back to the app everyday.</p>

        <p>The skills involved in using and mastering Unity are the most crucial to tackle. Seeing as it is one of the top
        game engines, it is easy to find ways to learn how to use it through tutorials on YouTube or if necessary paid
        learning options like SkillShare. Unity is coded through C#, a programming language which also would need to be
        learned. Assets of the game will be modeled in Blender, a free program which is also very popular.</p>

        <p>If the project is successful, millions of people across the world will be able to understand and learn coping
        techniques when it comes to mental health. Overall, if people understood their own mental health and understood
        that others may also suffer with their own struggles, we as a human race could be more kind and caring to one
        another.</p>
