        <h1>Project</h1>

        <p> I decided on making a portable, carriable Raspberry Pi 4 based computer with an emphasis on input for
            enthusiast
            programmers and manufacturers. I aim to focus mostly on input, including a quality mechanical keyboard and
            controller device. A
            Raspberry Pi is a cheap single board computer that is roughly the size of a credit card but 1-2cm in height.
            The
            Raspberry Pi foundation recently released a Raspberry Pi 4 with 8GB of ram that is much more suited to being
            a
            desktop PC
            replacement
            then the previous editions. </p>

        <p> I have a few Raspberry Pi’s and Raspberry Pi run devices and they usually lack a physical keyboard, relying
            on a
            touch screen instead for portability and affordability. The problem with this is using the Pi for typing
            lines of
            code or
            controlling machinery can feel clunky or unsatisfying on a tiny bluetooth keyboard. When typing, the
            feedback of
            key presses is important for speed and precision and when operating machines, such as CNC or laser cutter,
            you are
            most likely
            wearing gloves for safety, which inhibits the use of a touch screen, and makes the use of tiny keys hard.
        </p>

        <p> The aim is to make the input devices the main feature of the product. A Raspberry Pi is a single board
            computer
            that can have many uses, and is affordable at ~$100AUD. Rather than focusing on a big screen, the mechanical
            keyboard will be the
            largest part of the product, putting a limited budget more in the keyboard than screen. This device will
            have the
            ability to run either on batteries or mains powered. Allowing for portability for the programmer and
            stability for
            the hobbyist
            manufacturer. The keyboard will be a full 104 key 100% keyboard with mechanical switches. Mechanical
            switches are
            preferred by gamers as they are considered faster and longer lasting, this is beneficial to programmers too.
            Raspberry Pi’s are
            mostly run on Raspbian which is based on Linux. Linux and it’s command line are favourable for programmers.
            The
            included battery will allow the user to carry the device around like a laptop, but still having the added
            plus of
            a good solid
            mechanical keyboard.
            <br>
            As for manufacturing, the Raspberry Pi can run a lot of g code senders which are used to control CNC
            machines,
            laser cutters and 3D printers. These machines are usually run outside in an enthusiast's garage as they are
            loud
            and messy. Aimed at
            hobbyists, they don’t have the money for a big computer that is suited to the environment nor the space to
            just
            leave it around. The Raspberry Pi also has the advantage of being quite sturdy and doesn’t have moving parts
            like
            pc fans or
            mechanical harddrives that could be easily damaged in such an environment. The user could easily plug in for
            e.g.
            a 3D printer, complete their work and then unplug the machine and use it with another machine elsewhere.
            <br>
            The device will look similar to a laptop with a clam shell design. The length and width will be taken from
            the
            dimensions of the full sized keyboard - roughly 43cm by 16cm, plus the height of the keys which differ but
            could
            be estimated at 2cm.
            The keyboard being the bottom of the clam shell and the top being split for the screen on the left and the
            Raspberry Pi on the right, allowing for all the input and output ports to be accessible. These ports include
            USB C
            for power, data
            transfer, input devices and an output for a display. This is also so the elements of the product, the
            screen,
            keyboard and Raspberry Pi allow for future upgrade or replacement. The user could also plug in devices such
            as
            joystick to help
            control
            for e.g. a CNC machine or a wired mouse. This area would also be home to the battery and charging elements.
            A
            battery of 5,000-10,000mAh would be sufficient for the product as the screen would be rather small and not
            use too
            much power. However
            at 5,000-10,000mAh, it would still last long enough to use portably. </p>

        <p> A Raspberry Pi 4 would be required which would run on Raspian. In this case it will be used with it’s front
            end
            graphical user interface that operates similar to any other operating system GUI such as a Windows desktop
            environment. The
            housing
            could be designed in a CAD software and either 3D printed or milled using a CNC. The mechanical keyboard
            would be
            purchased or built by the user if they desire.</p>

        <p>The skills required are not too advanced. Setting up Raspbian on a Raspberry Pi is very easy and can easily
            be
            done following instructions on <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/help/noobs-setup/2/"> their website</a>.
            Most
            of the elements
            would be plug in
            and play, except for the housing which could be supplied using a digital .stl file allowing it to be 3D
            printed by
            the user or an external 3D printing service at cost. A small amount of soldering would be required to set up
            the
            battery and
            charging element. As this is aimed at hobbyists, the skills would be already known.</p>

        <p>If the project is successful, hobbyists would have an inexpensive way to program or control machinery. The
            problem of Raspberry Pi based computers feeling cheap and uncomfortable to use would be solved through the
            mechanical keyboard alone.
            Hobbyists would be able to focus more on their work then what device to use all while saving money on buying
            another laptop or PC.</p>
