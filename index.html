  <h1>About </h1>
  Natalie Cursio
  <p>S @student.rmit.edu.au
    24 year old born and bred Melburnian interested in technology.
    Italian background, enjoys strong espressos and this self
    isolation period a little too much.</p>


  <p>My interest in IT began as a child, when in a thunderstorm, my apple 2 was struck by lightning while I was using it. But in reality, I was born in the mid 1990’s, and since a young age, technology was evolving like pokemon around me. I would
    always pull apart my electronic devices, curious with how it all worked. Today I still pull apart devices, but builds devices, fixes them and collects parts from them. I don’t have any professional IT experience, but I have a lot of
    enthusiast/hobby experience in 3D modelling, 3D manufacturing (CNC, 3D printing), PCB design and manufacturing, PC building and soldering.</p>

  <p>I chose to study at RMIT as it’s my local university, and I have a previous degree from RMIT. RMIT has a lot of professional interaction and connections in the IT world, especially in Melbourne Australia.</p>

  <p>During my studies, I aim to formalise and expand my knowledge of Information Technology. I expect to learn more about the professional industries in the field, for example: software development and engineering, computer system networking and
    maintenance, the IT security sector and programming. In turn this will help me find the area of IT that I enjoy the most to make a life out of it.

  <p>Auditory: 20%

</p>

  <h3 class="test">The Big Five Personality Test</h3>
  <p>Openness 73% Conscientiousness 42% Extraversion 52% Agreeableness 58% Neuroticism 71%</p>

<p>A common result between the three of these tests is that I am more open to explore when it comes to ideas, opinions and learning, disregarding traditional methods. Culture, art and creativity seem to come up a lot, further supporting the fact that I thrive in non traditional settings. I’m actually quite surprised with the niche accuracy of the Myers Briggs test. One critique I have with my results is how creative it says I am, as I often feel doubtful of this.
<br>
My Myers Briggs results lean more towards the side of introvert, it also points out that I am less competitive but more cooperative and supportive of social harmony. These two traits would be beneficial in a team environment. However, my negative traits, “neuroticism” in the big five personality test, and “turbulent” in the Myers Briggs test, could cause me to struggle with self doubt about my place in a group situation. I know this to be true as I struggle with social anxiety.
<br>
When it comes to forming a team, I think it would be good to have a balance of traditional and non traditional types. The traditional type learners and workers would help steady the ship to stay on task, whereas the non traditional types could help bring something new to the work at hand. The “mediator” personality type thrives with people similar to them, so maybe when forming a group it would be good to find other mediator types, although it may be hard as we form only 4% of the population.</p>
