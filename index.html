    <p>email: S3505918@student.rmit.edu.au

      <br>24 year old born and bred Melburnian interested in technology.
      Italian background, enjoys strong espressos and this self
      isolation period a little too much.</p>
    <hr>

    <p>My interest in IT began as a child, when in a thunderstorm, my Compact Mac was struck by lightning while I was
      using it. But in reality, I was born in the mid 1990’s, and since a young age, technology was evolving like
      pokemon around me. I would
      always pull apart my electronic devices, curious with how it all worked. Today I still pull apart devices, but
      builds devices, fixes them and collects parts from them. I don’t have any professional IT experience, but I have a
      lot of
      enthusiast/hobby experience in 3D modelling, 3D manufacturing (CNC, 3D printing), PCB design and manufacturing, PC
      building and soldering.</p>

    <p>I chose to study at RMIT as it’s my local university, and I have a previous degree from RMIT. RMIT has a lot of
      professional interaction and connections in the IT world, especially in Melbourne Australia.</p>

    <p>During my studies, I aim to formalise and expand my knowledge of Information Technology. I expect to learn more
      about the professional industries in the field, for example: software development and engineering, computer system
      networking and
      maintenance, the IT security sector and programming. In turn this will help me find the area of IT that I enjoy
      the most to make a life out of it.

    <p>Personaliy test results</p>

    <h3>Myers-Briggs</h3>
    <p>Mediator
      INFP-T</p>

    <h3>Learning Style</h3>
    <p>Auditory: 20%
      Visual: 35%
      Tactile: 45%
      You are a Tactile learner!
    </p>

    <h3>The Big Five Personality Test</h3>
    <p>Openness 73% Conscientiousness 42% Extraversion 52% Agreeableness 58% Neuroticism 71%</p>

    <p>A common result between the three of these tests is that I am more open to explore when it comes to ideas,
      opinions and learning, disregarding traditional methods. Culture, art and creativity seem to come up a lot,
      further supporting the fact
      that I thrive in non traditional settings. I’m actually quite surprised with the niche accuracy of the Myers
      Briggs test. One critique I have with my results is how creative it says I am, as I often feel doubtful of this.
    </p>

    <p>My Myers Briggs results lean more towards the side of introvert, it also points out that I am less competitive
      but more cooperative and supportive of social harmony. These two traits would be beneficial in a team environment.
      However, my
      negative traits, “neuroticism” in the big five personality test, and “turbulent” in the Myers Briggs test, could
      cause me to struggle with self doubt about my place in a group situation. I know this to be true as I struggle
      with social anxiety.
    </p>

    <p>When it comes to forming a team, I think it would be good to have a balance of traditional and non traditional
      types. The traditional type learners and workers would help steady the ship to stay on task, whereas the non
      traditional types could
      help bring something new to the work at hand. The “mediator” personality type thrives with people similar to them,
      so maybe when forming a group it would be good to find other mediator types, although it may be hard as we form
      only 4% of the
      population.</p>

    <h1 id="T3">Ideal Job</h1>

    <p>The ideal job I chose is UI Game Programmer. UI refers to the user interface, and UX refers to the user
      experience. These are the “front end” of the game that the player interacts with the most. This appeals to me as
      when I play video games or
      use software, I can be picky with user interfaces and to me they can make or break a good experience. I would love
      to be involved in making the navigation and experience easy and intuitive. Plus, working in a game studio would be
      a dream come
      true as video games have been a big part of my entire life.

    <p>This job requires two years development experience of UI and UX, experience with wire-framing and prototyping. It
      also requires knowledge of XAML(standing for Extensible Application Markup Language), WPF (Windows Presentation
      Foundation),
      Blend,
      C#/C++ and version control using git. XAML is a language used in WPF and WPF is a UI framework used to build
      Windows applications. Microsoft Blend is used for UI design.
      Some skills and experience that are preferred are Noesis GUI, game development, JavaScript, HTML 5, CSS3, Adobe
      Suite and UX design. A bachelor of arts in computer science or similar is also a plus in applying for this job.
    </p>

    <p>I don’t have any formal education in regards to the skills and experience required. I do have a solid hobby
      background in Adobe Suite, especially Photoshop and Illustrator which I have used for around 10 years.</p>

    <p>Completing the Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT would be my highest priority in order to gain the
      required skills. We have already started using Git and I am sure it would be a big part of the rest of the course.
      I would aim to
      complete electives in C++ Object-Oriented Programming and further programming. To get further qualifications and
      develop skills in XAML, Blend and WPF, I would do an additional course in User Interface design.</p>

    <h1 id="T4">Project</h1>

    <p> I decided on making a portable, carriable Raspberry Pi 4 based computer with an emphasis on input for enthusiast
      programmers and manufacturers. I aim to focus mostly on input, including a quality mechanical keyboard and
      controller device. A
      Raspberry Pi is a cheap single board computer that is roughly the size of a credit card but 1-2cm in height. The
      Raspberry Pi foundation recently released a Raspberry Pi 4 with 8GB of ram that is much more suited to being a
      desktop PC
      replacement
      then the previous editions. </p>

    <p> I have a few Raspberry Pi’s and Raspberry Pi run devices and they usually lack a physical keyboard, relying on a
      touch screen instead for portability and affordability. The problem with this is using the Pi for typing lines of
      code or
      controlling machinery can feel clunky or unsatisfying on a tiny bluetooth keyboard. When typing, the feedback of
      key presses is important for speed and precision and when operating machines, such as CNC or laser cutter, you are
      most likely
      wearing gloves for safety, which inhibits the use of a touch screen, and makes the use of tiny keys hard.</p>

    <p> The aim is to make the input devices the main feature of the product. A Raspberry Pi is a single board computer
      that can have many uses, and is affordable at ~$100AUD. Rather than focusing on a big screen, the mechanical
      keyboard will be the
      largest part of the product, putting a limited budget more in the keyboard than screen. This device will have the
      ability to run either on batteries or mains powered. Allowing for portability for the programmer and stability for
      the hobbyist
      manufacturer. The keyboard will be a full 104 key 100% keyboard with mechanical switches. Mechanical switches are
      preferred by gamers as they are considered faster and longer lasting, this is beneficial to programmers too.
      Raspberry Pi’s are
      mostly run on Raspbian which is based on Linux. Linux and it’s command line are favourable for programmers. The
      included battery will allow the user to carry the device around like a laptop, but still having the added plus of
      a good solid
      mechanical keyboard.
      <br>
      As for manufacturing, the Raspberry Pi can run a lot of g code senders which are used to control CNC machines,
      laser cutters and 3D printers. These machines are usually run outside in an enthusiast's garage as they are loud
      and messy. Aimed at
      hobbyists, they don’t have the money for a big computer that is suited to the environment nor the space to just
      leave it around. The Raspberry Pi also has the advantage of being quite sturdy and doesn’t have moving parts like
      pc fans or
      mechanical harddrives that could be easily damaged in such an environment. The user could easily plug in for e.g.
      a 3D printer, complete their work and then unplug the machine and use it with another machine elsewhere.
      <br>
      The device will look similar to a laptop with a clam shell design. The length and width will be taken from the
      dimensions of the full sized keyboard - roughly 43cm by 16cm, plus the height of the keys which differ but could
      be estimated at 2cm.
      The keyboard being the bottom of the clam shell and the top being split for the screen on the left and the
      Raspberry Pi on the right, allowing for all the input and output ports to be accessible. These ports include USB C
      for power, data
      transfer, input devices and an output for a display. This is also so the elements of the product, the screen,
      keyboard and Raspberry Pi allow for future upgrade or replacement. The user could also plug in devices such as
      joystick to help
      control
      for e.g. a CNC machine or a wired mouse. This area would also be home to the battery and charging elements. A
      battery of 5,000-10,000mAh would be sufficient for the product as the screen would be rather small and not use too
      much power. However
      at 5,000-10,000mAh, it would still last long enough to use portably. </p>

    <p> A Raspberry Pi 4 would be required which would run on Raspian. In this case it will be used with it’s front end
      graphical user interface that operates similar to any other operating system GUI such as a Windows desktop
      environment. The
      housing
      could be designed in a CAD software and either 3D printed or milled using a CNC. The mechanical keyboard would be
      purchased or built by the user if they desire.</p>

    <p>The skills required are not too advanced. Setting up Raspbian on a Raspberry Pi is very easy and can easily be
      done following instructions on <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/help/noobs-setup/2/"> their website</a>. Most
      of the elements
      would be plug in
      and play, except for the housing which could be supplied using a digital .stl file allowing it to be 3D printed by
      the user or an external 3D printing service at cost. A small amount of soldering would be required to set up the
      battery and
      charging element. As this is aimed at hobbyists, the skills would be already known.</p>

    <p>If the project is successful, hobbyists would have an inexpensive way to program or control machinery. The
      problem of Raspberry Pi based computers feeling cheap and uncomfortable to use would be solved through the
      mechanical keyboard alone.
      Hobbyists would be able to focus more on their work then what device to use all while saving money on buying
      another laptop or PC.</p>
