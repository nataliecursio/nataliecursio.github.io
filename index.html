<h1>About </h1>
Natalie Cursio
<p>My interest in IT began as a child, when in a thunderstorm, my apple 2 was struck by lightning while I was using it. But in reality, I was born in the mid 1990’s, and since a young age, technology was evolving like pokemon around me. I would always pull apart my electronic devices, curious with how it all worked. Today I still pull apart devices, but builds devices, fixes them and collects parts from them. I don’t have any professional IT experience, but I have a lot of enthusiast/hobby experience in 3D modelling, 3D manufacturing (CNC, 3D printing), PCB design and manufacturing, PC building and soldering.</p>

<p>I chose to study at RMIT as it’s my local university, and I have a previous degree from RMIT. RMIT has a lot of professional interaction and connections in the IT world, especially in Melbourne Australia.</p>

<p>During my studies, I aim to formalise and expand my knowledge of Information Technology. I expect to learn more about the professional industries in the field, for example: software development and engineering, computer system networking and maintenance, the IT security sector and programming. In turn this will help me find the area of IT that I enjoy the most to make a life out of it.
