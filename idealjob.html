        <p>The ideal job I chose is UI Game Programmer. UI refers to the user interface, and UX refers to the user
            experience. These are the “front end” of the game that the player interacts with the most. This appeals to
            me as
            when I play video games or
            use software, I can be picky with user interfaces and to me they can make or break a good experience. I
            would love
            to be involved in making the navigation and experience easy and intuitive. Plus, working in a game studio
            would be
            a dream come
            true as video games have been a big part of my entire life.

        <p>This job requires two years development experience of UI and UX, experience with wire-framing and
            prototyping. It
            also requires knowledge of XAML(standing for Extensible Application Markup Language), WPF (Windows
            Presentation
            Foundation),
            Blend,
            C#/C++ and version control using git. XAML is a language used in WPF and WPF is a UI framework used to build
            Windows applications. Microsoft Blend is used for UI design.
            Some skills and experience that are preferred are Noesis GUI, game development, JavaScript, HTML 5, CSS3,
            Adobe
            Suite and UX design. A bachelor of arts in computer science or similar is also a plus in applying for this
            job.
        </p>

        <p>I don’t have any formal education in regards to the skills and experience required. I do have a solid hobby
            background in Adobe Suite, especially Photoshop and Illustrator which I have used for around 10 years.</p>

        <p>Completing the Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT would be my highest priority in order to gain the
            required skills. We have already started using Git and I am sure it would be a big part of the rest of the
            course.
            I would aim to
            complete electives in C++ Object-Oriented Programming and further programming. To get further qualifications
            and
            develop skills in XAML, Blend and WPF, I would do an additional course in User Interface design.</p>
