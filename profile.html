    <p>email: S3505918@student.rmit.edu.au

      <br>24 year old born and bred Melburnian interested in technology.
      Italian background, enjoys strong espressos and this self
      isolation period a little too much.</p>

    <p>My interest in IT began as a child, when in a thunderstorm, my Compact Mac was struck by lightning while I was
      using it. But in reality, I was born in the mid 1990’s, and since a young age, technology was evolving like
      pokemon around me. I would
      always pull apart my electronic devices, curious with how it all worked. Today I still pull apart devices, but
      builds devices, fixes them and collects parts from them. I don’t have any professional IT experience, but I have a
      lot of
      enthusiast/hobby experience in 3D modelling, 3D manufacturing (CNC, 3D printing), PCB design and manufacturing, PC
      building and soldering.</p>

    <p>I chose to study at RMIT as it’s my local university, and I have a previous degree from RMIT. RMIT has a lot of
      professional interaction and connections in the IT world, especially in Melbourne Australia.</p>

    <p>During my studies, I aim to formalise and expand my knowledge of Information Technology. I expect to learn more
      about the professional industries in the field, for example: software development and engineering, computer system
      networking and
      maintenance, the IT security sector and programming. In turn this will help me find the area of IT that I enjoy
      the most to make a life out of it.
