        <hr>
        <p>A common result between the three of these tests is that I am more open to explore when it comes to ideas,
            opinions and learning, disregarding traditional methods. Culture, art and creativity seem to come up a lot,
            further supporting the fact
            that I thrive in non traditional settings. I’m actually quite surprised with the niche accuracy of the Myers
            Briggs test. One critique I have with my results is how creative it says I am, as I often feel doubtful of
            this.
        </p>

        <p>My Myers Briggs results lean more towards the side of introvert, it also points out that I am less
            competitive
            but more cooperative and supportive of social harmony. These two traits would be beneficial in a team
            environment.
            However, my
            negative traits, “neuroticism” in the big five personality test, and “turbulent” in the Myers Briggs test,
            could
            cause me to struggle with self doubt about my place in a group situation. I know this to be true as I
            struggle
            with anxiety and social anxiety. Something I struggle with the most, trying to "mind read" people, and interpreting it as judgement.
            Knowing people's personality traits is advantagous for me here as it helps me to understand their
            though process. 
        </p>

        <p>When it comes to forming a team, I think it would be good to have a balance of traditional and non
            traditional
            types. The traditional type learners and workers would help steady the ship to stay on task, whereas the non
            traditional types could
            help bring something new to the work at hand. The “mediator” personality type thrives with people similar to
            them,
            so maybe when forming a group it would be good to find other mediator types, although it may be hard as we
            form
            only 4% of the
            population.</p>
