        <p>email: S3505918@student.rmit.edu.au

            <br>24 year old born and bred Melburnian interested in technology.
            Italian background, enjoys strong espressos and this self
            isolation period a little too much.</p>

        <p>My interest in IT began as a child, when in a thunderstorm, my Compact Mac was struck by lightning while I
            was
            using it. But in reality, I was born in the mid 1990’s, and since a young age, technology was evolving like
            pokemon around me. I would
            always pull apart my electronic devices, curious with how it all worked. Today I still pull apart devices,
            but
            builds devices, fixes them and collects parts from them. I don’t have any professional IT experience, but I
            have a
            lot of
            enthusiast/hobby experience in 3D modelling, 3D manufacturing (CNC, 3D printing), PCB design and
            manufacturing, PC
            building and soldering.</p>

        <p>I chose to study at RMIT as it’s my local university, and I have a previous degree from RMIT. RMIT has a lot
            of
            professional interaction and connections in the IT world, especially in Melbourne Australia.</p>

        <p>During my studies, I aim to formalise and expand my knowledge of Information Technology. I expect to learn
            more
            about the professional industries in the field, for example: software development and engineering, computer
            system
            networking and
            maintenance, the IT security sector and programming. In turn this will help me find the area of IT that I
            enjoy
            the most to make a life out of it.

        <p>Personaliy test results</p>

        <h3>Myers-Briggs</h3>
        <p>Mediator
            INFP-T</p>

        <h3>Learning Style</h3>
        <p>Auditory: 20%
            Visual: 35%
            Tactile: 45%
            You are a Tactile learner!
        </p>

        <h3>The Big Five Personality Test</h3>
        <p>Openness 73% Conscientiousness 42% Extraversion 52% Agreeableness 58% Neuroticism 71%</p>

        <p>A common result between the three of these tests is that I am more open to explore when it comes to ideas,
            opinions and learning, disregarding traditional methods. Culture, art and creativity seem to come up a lot,
            further supporting the fact
            that I thrive in non traditional settings. I’m actually quite surprised with the niche accuracy of the Myers
            Briggs test. One critique I have with my results is how creative it says I am, as I often feel doubtful of
            this.
        </p>

        <p>My Myers Briggs results lean more towards the side of introvert, it also points out that I am less
            competitive
            but more cooperative and supportive of social harmony. These two traits would be beneficial in a team
            environment.
            However, my
            negative traits, “neuroticism” in the big five personality test, and “turbulent” in the Myers Briggs test,
            could
            cause me to struggle with self doubt about my place in a group situation. I know this to be true as I
            struggle
            with social anxiety.
        </p>

        <p>When it comes to forming a team, I think it would be good to have a balance of traditional and non
            traditional
            types. The traditional type learners and workers would help steady the ship to stay on task, whereas the non
            traditional types could
            help bring something new to the work at hand. The “mediator” personality type thrives with people similar to
            them,
            so maybe when forming a group it would be good to find other mediator types, although it may be hard as we
            form
            only 4% of the
            population.</p>
